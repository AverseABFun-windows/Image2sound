# Image2sound
Image2sound is a python script that can be ran at the command line or imported, and can convert an image or video into an audio file.
## Interaction
At the command line, you can just pass a image or mp4 file and it will output a freq.wav file that contains the frequency, and if you import it you can use the image2sound or video2sound functions and choose if you want it to output to freq.wav or return it as a numpy array.
